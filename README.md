# Task Manager

First project of my return to coding. Simplest task manager possible, using React.js for the frontend and an HTTP API using Go Echo

# How to run locally

In the frontend directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

In the main directory, you can run

### `go run backend/main.go`

Will start the app
